            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.
            Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them. </p>
                <br>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, 
                and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example: </p>    
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
                         For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as
                          mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, 
                        server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation 
                        to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. </p></li>    
                </ul>

            <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW). </li>
                <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, 
                    try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>

            <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. 
                The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. 
                JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which 
                was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
            <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime 
                system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.</p>
            <p>JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. 
                The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects.</p>

            <header>Hello world</header>
            <article><p>Hello this is a hello world code for JavaScript.</p>
                <p>open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code: </p>
                 <div id="coder">
                     <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }</code>
                     <code>  greetMe("World");</code>
                 </div>
                 <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser! </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. 
                The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules. </p>
            <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); 
                subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).</p>
                <p> Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) 
                    and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase). </p>

            <header>Variable scope</header>
            <article>
                <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, 
                    because it is available to any other code in the current document.</p>
                <p> When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable,
                     because it is available only within that function. </p>
